1) Bugs:
- Stats are shared between saves. Should be fixed first
- You can open the window infinitely
	- The window also does not open when you open it
- Most of the sfx are broken. We should really fix them.

2) Optimizations
- Should have a label for the start of each day (maybe an if-statement that decides what you do each time you wake up?), separate from gameplay sections
- General Game Balancing stuff

3) Cookie Features:
- Replace menu items with clickable buttons on screen
- Farm merge valley cooking minigame
- Replace GUI
- Replace font
- Replace art and placeholders
	- Room should be messy. My room is very messy
	- Ending cutscenes should have better art and not look like I sketched them in 5 minutes
	- Redesign the fairy (Mostly her outfit I think her hair looks cute enough)
- Pee health bonus if you drank water before going to the bathroom (mention it in dialogue too)
- Have some events that are inspired by You feel like shit.
	- Reminders to take meds
	- Grounding exercises for anxiety
	- etc.
- Cutscene for opening the window. 
- Transitions between different fairy expressions LOL, maybe make her move around or have an idle animation
